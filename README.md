# Data Platform Project Using Modern Data Engineering Stack
## Introduction
Welcome to our Data Platform Project, a comprehensive and sophisticated solution engineered to demonstrate cutting-edge skills in data engineering. This project is designed to showcase the integration and utilization of a diverse set of tools in building an advanced data platform. Our solution leverages Docker for building and deploying the following technology stack:

- Storage: MinIO - High performance, Kubernetes-native object storage, ideal for managing large-scale data in a distributed environment.
- Data Processing: Apache Spark - A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
- Data Storage Format: Delta Lake - An open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads.
- Data Orchestrator Tools: Mage.ai - A data orchestration tool to automate and streamline data pipelines.
- Data Modelling & ETL: dbt (data build tool) - A command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively.
- Data Query Engine: Trino - A distributed SQL query engine designed for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes.
- Semantic Data Model: Cube.dev - An open-source analytical API platform that is primarily used to build internal business intelligence tools or add customer-facing analytics to existing applications.
- Data Visualization: Metabase - An easy, open-source way for everyone in your company to ask questions and learn from data.

The purpose of this project is not just to demonstrate the technical prowess in data engineering but also to serve as a reference model for building scalable, efficient, and robust data platforms.

## Project Overview

This project is containerized using Docker, ensuring a seamless setup and deployment process. Each component of our data stack is carefully chosen and integrated to provide a comprehensive experience in data processing, from storage and ETL processes to querying, modeling, and visualization.
